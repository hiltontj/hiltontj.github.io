Trevor's Page Repo
==================

A repository for storing my webpage.

## Dependancies
In general, this site is powered using Jekyll, so to get it running, you should follow the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

Once all of that is installed properly, to bundle and run the site on your local, navigate to the `docs/` folder and execute the following command:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
