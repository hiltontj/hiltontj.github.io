Hi, welcome to my blog. This is the first post of what I hope to be many. I aim to start posting about some projects that I have been working on; namely, a cool stats and analytics project that makes use of the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API. So be sure to check back in for more on that! But for now, I'll just give a quick introduction to myself and this website.

As my homepage page says, I am a software engineer. I am relatively new to the profession, developing software professionally for coming up on three years now. However, software has been in my day-to-day since I learned to code in C# in my first year of university. I have always found coding to be fun, and addictive; and when you mix those aspects in with the collaborative design process and methodologies of engineering, I don't think that there could be a more ideal line of work. I am absolutely thrilled to be able to do this for a living.

Outside of coding for work, or for fun, I have an abundance of hobbies and interests: I like to play keyboards, jam out, and produce music; I am into shooting and developing film photographs; I love to cook; I do powerlifting; I play ultimate frisbee; the list goes on. I therefore created this website in an attempt to channel all of these outlets into some semblence of form. I figured that maybe if I start writing about all these things that it will make me more focused in my endeavors. And who knows, maybe someone will find it interesting :)
