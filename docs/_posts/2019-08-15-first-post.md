Hi, welcome to my blog. This is the first post of what I hope to be many. I aim to start posting about some projects that I have been working on; namely, a cool analytics project that I have been working on that makes use of the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API. So be sure to check back in for more on that! But for now, I'll just give a quick introduction to myself and this website.

## About me

As my homepage page says, I am a software engineer. I am relatively new to the profession, developing software professionally for coming up on three years now. However, software has been in my day-to-day since I learned to code in C# in my first year of university. I have always found coding to be fun, and addictive; and when you mix those aspects in with the collaborative design process and methodologies of engineering, I don't think that there could be a more ideal line of work. I am absolutely thrilled to be able to do this for a living.
